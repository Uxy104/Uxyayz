            I realize how much my actions have hurt you. Hurting you is the last thing I ever wanted to do, and I know I failed in showing you the love, care, and respect that you truly deserve. 
            You mean the world to me, and it breaks my heart to know that I've caused you pain. I've spent a lot of time thinking about the things I did wrong, and I know that I have a lot to make up for. 
            Please know that my intentions were never to hurt you.
        </p>

            I miss you, Yuki--your smile, your laughter, and everything about you that makes my life so much better. I want to be the person you can rely on, trust, and feel safe with. 
            I promise you, from the bottom of my heart, that I will be that man--the man who will love you unconditionally and treat you with the kindness and love you deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am ready to do whatever it takes to rebuild what we've lost. I love you more than words can say, and I hope you can find it in your heart to give me another chance. 
            Please come back to me, Yuki. I am committed to being the man you can count on--the man you will marry one day.
        </p>
